Weighted Average: Just like departments aggregate objectives, divisions aggregate departments using weighted averages.

Score Flow:

KeyResult scores → weighted avg → Objective score
Objective scores → weighted avg → Department score
Department scores → weighted avg → Division score
Dynamic Score Levels: Your system uses ScoreLevelService to define customizable score levels (Below, Meets, Good, etc.), so division scores automatically work with any level configuration.

Multi-Source Evaluations: If you want divisions to have manual evaluations (like departments do), you can extend the evaluation system to support targetType="DIVISION".
