Currently, OKR tracking system has a flat structure. Department -> Employee.

- Before i had departments like Sales, HR, PMO and employees are assigned to them
- After: I will have divisions (like "Commercial Division" or "Technology Division") and each division can contain multiple departments which then contains employees

├── Commercial Division
│   ├── Retail Banking Department
│   │   ├── Employee: John Doe
│   │   └── Employee: Jane Smith
│   ├── Corporate Banking Department
│   │   └── Employee: Bob Johnson
│   └── Sales Department
│       └── Employee: Alice Williams
│
├── Technology Division
│   ├── Software Engineering Department
│   │   ├── Employee: Dev One
│   │   └── Employee: Dev Two
│   └── IT Support Department
│       └── Employee: Support Person
│
└── Operations Division
    ├── HR Department
    └── Finance Department


Better Organization: Large organizations have multiple layers of management
Accurate Reporting: Division leaders can see all departments under them
Scalability: Easy to add new divisions without restructuring everything
Clear Hierarchy: Everyone knows who reports to whom




I need to:

- Create new Division entity
- Add division_id foreign key to Department table
- Departments must belong to a Division (required relationship)
- Users still assigned to departments (not divisions directly)


Database changes:
What is JPA?

JPA (Java Persistence API) is a way to map Java objects to database tables. Think of it as a translator between your Java code and SQL database.

Relationship Types:

@OneToMany: One parent can have many children (e.g., one Division has many Departments)
@ManyToOne: Many children belong to one parent (e.g., many Departments belong to one Division)
@ManyToMany: Many-to-many relationship (e.g., many Users assigned to many Departments)
