What this migration does:
- Creates new division table with all columns
- Adds division_id column to department table (initially nullable)
- Creates a default division called "Default Division"
- Assigns ALL existing departments to this default division
- Makes division_id required (not null)


Why This Approach?

- Safe: Existing data is preserved
- Reversible: Each changeset can be rolled back
- Trackable: You know exactly what changed and when
- Production-Ready: Professional approach used in real companies
